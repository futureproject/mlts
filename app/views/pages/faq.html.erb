      <h2>What is Tugg?</h2>
      <li>Tugg is a platform that helps fans bring their favorite alternative content to theaters across the country.</li>
      <li>Tugg creates community-driven events turning social interest into action.</li>
      <li>Crowdsourced screenings show theaters that there’s enough demand for a film event if enough pre-sold tickets are sold before the deadline.</li>

      <h2>How does Tugg work?</h2>
      <li>Events will only happen if enough tickets are reserved in advance to meet the threshold, so spread the word to your friends and family!
        <li>Tugg emails tickets to attendees when threshold is met</li>
        <li>If an event does not meet threshold before its deadline, the screening will be called off and no one is charged for their ticket reservation.</li>

        <h2>My city doesn’t have a screening. How can I see Most Likely to Succeed in theaters?</h2>
        <p>Visit the <a href="#">Most Likely to Succeed page at Tugg</a> for more information on how to bring “Most Likely to Succeed” to your city! Have questions? Email support@tugginc.com</p>

        <h2>What if an event sells out?</h2>
        <li>Tugg will do their best to upgrade quickly to a larger house and even add a second screening when possible</li>
        <li>Click “Follow Event” on the event page to be notified if more tickets become available.</li>

        <h2>Can I buy tickets at the door at the theater?</h2>
        <p>No, tickets need to be purchased through the event page. Tickets will remain on sale up until 4 hours prior to the event, pending availability.</p>

        <h2>I can’t find my tickets?</h2>
        <p>Tickets will only be emailed once the event meets threshold. Be sure to check your spam folder! If you still can't find your tickets email support@tugginc.com</p>
