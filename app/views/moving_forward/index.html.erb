        <p>People watching <i>Most Likely To Succeed</i> are inspired — but want to know, "What can I do next?" and “What other resources should I explore?”</p>
        </br>
        <p>The film immerses you in the lives of students and teachers at one school, then tells you not to copy them. Instead, we encourage you to create your own learning environment, leveraging the passions, expertise, and aspirations of your community. So how can you move forward?  For starters, we offer a set of <strong><a href="http://sparks.mltsfilm.org">MLTS Sparks</a></strong> -- short videos, discussion questions, and a process to help you move your school forward in a way you create and believe in.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Fortunately, many people, over many years, have done great work on how to elevate learning experiences.  There are several that are so good, we'll stake our reputation on them.  Start by becoming as much of an expert as you can with <strong><a href="/moving-forward/know-your-stuff">Know Your Stuff</a></strong>. Then we have specific suggested resources for parents, teachers, school leaders, students, and change agents. We welcome your feedback (e-mail us at <strong><a href="mailto:info@mlts.org">info@mlts.org</a></strong>).</p>

                    <p>As the saying goes, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there,” which pretty much summarizes the past few decades of U.S. education policy. But, take heart. There are exceptional talks, articles, and books that give you an informed perspective on education in the 21st Century. This section lays out a time-efficient way to advance your expertise.</p>
